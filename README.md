# iarc-k501-core
Canonical, execution-blocked archive kernel (K501). Frames-first · declarative · immutable · no push · no tracking.

IARC · eArc Kernel K501  
**Immutable Archive Runtime Core**

---

## Overview

**IARC** is a **declarative, non-executable archive system** designed for permanence, clarity, and trust.  
It is not an application, not a runtime, not an AI agent — it is a **canonical structure for recording truth, state, and system history**.

K501 marks the **Diamond Singularity**:  
the point where the kernel becomes **unchangeable** and all future work happens **around** it, never inside it.

## Core Properties

- **Archive-first** (no action without record)
- **Read-only by design**
- **Lossless, provenance-safe**
- **Human- & machine-readable**
- **No hidden state**
- **No autonomous execution**

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ No LLM  
- ❌ No agent  
- ❌ No automation  
- ❌ No push, no feed manipulation  
- ❌ No hidden memory  
- ❌ No behavior engine  

IARC **does not act**.  
It **remembers**.
